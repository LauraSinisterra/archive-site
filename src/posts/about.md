title: About this site  
---

This site is a repository for the body of work of Laura Sinisterra.
Designed and implemented by herself, works as a growing archive of intentional experimentation on the web. 

Laura is a visual designer and a philosophy undergrad student. Usually doing: creative work and theory; learning, reading and <a href="https://listed.to/@theimpermanent" target="_blank">writing on the internet.</a> 

Her work is inspired by diagrams, art theory and kitsch.
