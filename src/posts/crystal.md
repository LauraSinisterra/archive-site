<p class="text">
The crystal is neither opaque nor completely transparent.
</p>
<p class="text">
Based on my current research, on the crystal-image from Image-time in Deleuze. Starting as words, it goes from a cohesive unity into a reflected, diagrammatical version of itself.
</p>
<p class="text">
Analogous to the concept that is exploring, the artwork reflects the crystal and at the same time, becomes the reflection. The artwork exists because I made explicit the reference behind the artwork, the theory that makes its existence possible. What matters here is the operation of making visible the process and the structure of the thing.

<p class="text">
This is an artwork, a name that I created for it. This is my research, the thing that makes the artwork possible. This is the (digital) object, the actual and virtual artwork.
</p>
<p class="text">
The practice of the many aspects that composes who I am, come together in this piece. The artist, the thinker, the writer, the designer.
